## Prerequisites

Have a valid API Key to authenticate the requests. If you don't have one, please contact us at helpdesk@serpa.cloud

### Content-Type

All requests must include the `Content-type` header with the value `application/json`.

### Authentication

To authenticate the requests, you should add the `Authorization` header with a Bearer Token using your API Key.

```jsx
{
  "headers": {
    "Content-type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
  }
}

```

### Additional Considerations

1. In the following documentation, there are values in the variables that start with `VAR_`. These values are variables that you should send with the parameters you need.
2. The remaining values should be sent as documented in each use case.
3. You will be provided with an organization ID that you will have to send wherever `VAR_ORG_KEY` appears.
4. You will need to generate and share a Github Token that will be associated with your organization.

## Apps

---

An app is an entity that abstracts the git repository, the type of application, and the way it is compiled. From an app, different **deployments** can be generated in different **environments**.

> Query to list repositories
> 

```graphql
query GitSelectorQuery($provider: GitProvider!) {
  gitRepos(provider: $provider) {
    id
    name
    url
    ownerAvatar
  }
}

```

> Variables
> 

```json
{
  "provider": "GITHUB"
}

```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Save the `id` of the repository you are going to create your ***App*** on.

</aside>

All apps are created by associating them with an organization or user (namespace), and app names cannot be repeated within the same namespace. To validate the availability of a name in your namespace (your organization or user), you can use the following query:

> Query to validate app availability in a namespace
> 

```graphql
query AppNameAvailabilityQuery($name: String!, $org: ID!) {
  appNameAvailability(name: $name, org: $org)
}

```

> Variables
> 

```json
{
  "name": "VAR_APP_NAME",
  "org": "VAR_ORG_KEY"
}

```

> Mutation to create backend app
> 

```graphql
mutation CreateAppMutation(
  $input: AppInput!
  $triggerCompilation: Boolean
) {
  createApp(input: $input, triggerCompilation: $triggerCompilation) {
    id
    name
    createdAtFormatted
  }
}

```

> Variables
> 

```json
{
  "input": {
    "env": [],
    "name": "VAR_APP_NAME",
    "orgId": "VAR_ORG_KEY",
    "gitProvider": "GITHUB",
    "source": "VAR_GIT_REPO_ID",
    "dockerfileContent": "VAR_DOCKERFILE_CONTENT",
    "appType": "CONTAINER",
    "runtime": null,
    "preInstallCommand": null,
    "nodeVersion": null,
    "buildCommand": null,
    "buildPath": null,
  }
}

```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Save the `id` of your ***App***.

> Mutation to update dockerfile
> 

```graphql
mutation UpdateAppMutation($input: PatchAppInput!) {
  updateApp(input: $input) {
    id
    name
    createdAtFormatted
  }
}

```

> Variables
> 

```json
{
  "input": {
    "id": "VAR_APP_ID"
    "env": [],
    "dockerfileContent": "VAR_UPDATED_DOCKERFILE_CONTENT",
    "runtime": null,
    "preInstallCommand": null,
    "nodeVersion": null,
    "buildCommand": null,
    "buildPath": null,
  }
}

```

### Compile a version of your app

---

To generate a **build**, the first step is to identify the point in the git history of the repository associated with the application we want to compile. For this purpose, we can compile with a **ref** that can point to a **branch** or a **tag**, and in both cases, it is also necessary to know the **full hash** of that **commit**:

1. **For Tags:**
    1. Use the latest commit on which the tag was created.
    2. The **ref** follows the format `refs/tags/tag-name`, e.g. `refs/tags/v1.22.0`.
2. **For branches:**
    1. The commit must be part of the history of the specified branch.
    2. The **ref** follows the format `refs/heads/branch-name`, e.g. `refs/heads/main`.

If you don't have this information, you can list the available **branches** and **tags** for your app using the following queries:

> Queries to list branches and tags
> 

```graphql
query BranchesAndTagsQuery($appId: String!) {
  gitBranchesByApp(appId: $appId) {
    id
    name
    sha
  }
  gitTagsByApp(appId: $appId) {
    id
    name
    sha
  }
}

```

> Variables
> 

```json
{
  "appId": "VAR_APP_ID"
}

```

Once you have the **ref** and **sha**, you can execute the build using the following mutation:

> Mutation to create a new build
> 

```graphql
mutation BuildModalMutation($input: BuildInput!) {
  createBuild(input: $input) {
    id
  }
}

```

> Variables
> 

```json
{
  "input": {
    "sha": "VAR_SHA",
    "ref": "VAR_REF",
    "appId": "VAR_APP_ID"
  }
}

```

With the ID returned by the mutation, you can check the build status and its logs using the following query:

> Mutation to get build status
> 

```graphql
query BuildStatusQuery($id: ID!) {
  node(id: $id) {
    id
    ... on Build {
      id
      done
      buildTime
      status
      logs {
        payloads
      }
      artifact {
        id
        dockerTag
        commitUrl
        gitTagUrl
        commitShaShort
        commitDescription
      }
    }
  }
}

```

> Variables
> 

```json
{
  "id": "VAR_BUILD_ID"
}

```

### Create a deployment for your app

---

From the same app, you can generate multiple deployments. To create a new deployment, you will need the following data collected in the previous steps:

1. The ID of your app `VAR_APP_ID`.
2. The ID of your build `VAR_BUILD_ID`.
3. The ID of your organization `VAR_ORG_KEY`.
4. The ID of the environment where you want to deploy:
    1. If deploying to ***Sierra Negra***, use the key `DEFAULT`.
    2. If deploying to a managed environment, use the ID of your environment `VAR_ENV_ID`.

To obtain the ID of your environment, you can use the following query:

> Query to list environments
> 

```graphql
query EntitiesQuery(
  $first: Int
  $after: Cursor
  $sort: SortInput
  $filterMatrix: [[FilterInput]]
) {
  entities(
    sort: $
```

```json
{
  "input": {
    "app": "VAR_APP_ID",
    "org": "VAR_ORG_KEY",
    "build": "VAR_BUILD_ID",
    "name": "VAR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME",
    "environment": "VAR_ENV_ID",
    "env": [
      {
        "name": "VAR_SOME_ENV_VAR_PROPERTY",
        "value": "VAR_SOME_ENV_VAR_VALUE"
      }
    ],
    "postStartExecCommand": [],
    "replicas": 1,
    "volumeMounts": [],
    "volumes": [],
    "privacy": "PUBLIC",
    "enableCors": true,
    "allowOrigin": [],
    "allowHeaders": [],
    "allowMethods": [],
    "continousDeployment": "VAR_CD_RULE",
    "patternTag": "VAR_CD_TAG_REGEXP"
  }
}
```
